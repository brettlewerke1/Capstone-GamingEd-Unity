# Capstone-GamingEd-Unity

This repository is for the 2022 Capstone project RTX Gamification.

Our team name is GamingEd and is comprised of Grace Hsieh, Brett Lewerke, and Chayson Spigarelli.

The main executable for this project is located in UnityGame/CourseCreator.exe. You will need the whole folder downloaded to your machine in order for it to work. 

If you do not want to break the game as is, do not edit any other file in any folders.
